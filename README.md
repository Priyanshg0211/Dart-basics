# Dart Programming Basics for Flutter

Welcome to this repository dedicated to covering the fundamental aspects of Dart programming, geared towards getting started with Flutter development.

# Topics Covered

**Hello World:**
Introduction to Dart by printing "Hello, World!"

**Data Types in Dart:**
Explanation of various data types available in Dart, including integers, doubles, strings, booleans, and more.

**Operators in Dart:**
Overview of operators in Dart, covering arithmetic, logical, relational, and assignment operators.

**Strings in Dart:**
Basics of handling strings in Dart along with essential string functions and operations.

**Control Structures:**
Understanding control structures like if-else statements for conditional logic in Dart.

**Switch Case Concept:**
The switch-case statement is a powerful control flow tool used in programming. It provides an elegant way to handle multiple conditions by allowing the program to execute different blocks of code based on the value of an expression.

**Loops:**
Loops are fundamental structures in programming that allow the execution of a set of statements repeatedly. There are three main types of loops: for loop, while loop, and do-while loop.

1. For Loop -
The for loop is used when a statement or a block of statements needs to be executed a specific number of times.

2. While Loop -
The while loop is used when a statement or a block of statements needs to be executed as long as a given condition is true.

3. Do-While Loop -
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it ensures that the code inside the loop is executed at least once before checking the condition.

**Functions:**
Functions are modular blocks of code that perform a specific task. They promote code reusability and improve the maintainability of the code. Functions can take parameters and return values.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes for organizing code. It brings concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism into play.

1. Class - 
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the attributes and behaviors that the objects created from the class will have.

2. Object - 
An object is an instance of a class. It represents a real-world entity and encapsulates data and behavior.

3. Abstraction - 
Abstraction is a fundamental OOP concept that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share and many more.
